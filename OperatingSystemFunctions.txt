One major function of an operating system is controlling a device's off and on status. Operating systems can make a device turn off, and will have to be reloaded when a device is turned back on again. Devices can also be put into a sleep mode, or go through a reboot, where the device will turn back on after shutting down.

Operating systems also provide means managing programs. Operating systems may offer single task or multiple task functionality. When a multi-task OS has multiple programs running, the program currently being used is the active program, while the programs not actively being used are background tasks.

Monitoring performance is another tool that comes with operating systems. This tool allows users to view open programs and background tasks, as well as view real-time memory, CPU, disk, and network usage. Having access to this function makes trouble shooting performance issues easier.
